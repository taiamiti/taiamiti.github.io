# Data & AI Diagnostic Portfolio Content Details

This document contains the content details for your 5 Data & AI diagnostic portfolio projects. Please fill in the specific information for each project, and I'll update the portfolio entries accordingly.

## 1. Accounting Process AI Diagnostic (2017)

**Business Problem Statement:**

* The client wanted to explore the potential of AI for accounting workflows, driven by the rising hype around deep learning and document understanding.
* Objective was to assess which accounting processes (e.g., invoice processing, reconciliation, reporting) could realistically be automated with AI.
* A key requirement was to provide **budget estimates** for building an invoice parsing software and other AI-enabled automations.
* The diagnostic also examined risk factors, feasibility constraints, and business areas with the strongest potential ROI.

**Key Findings & Recommendations:**

* Invoice parsing using AI (OCR + NLP) was identified as the most promising entry point.
* Expense categorization and anomaly detection in financial reporting were highlighted as viable medium-term opportunities.
* Reconciliation and compliance checking were identified as longer-term, higher complexity use cases.
* Risks included data quality issues, change management in finance teams, and uncertainty of vendor tool maturity.
* While many invoices are available, they are only partially annotated for AI to train on it directly as accounting processes skip or do not save certain required annotation.

**Quantifiable Outcomes:**

* Budget scenarios for invoice parsing software implementation were outlined, ranging from **€150K–€250K** for an initial deployment.
* Expected benefits: **50–70% reduction in manual data entry time** and faster invoice turnaround.

**Recommended Next Steps:**

* Phase 1: Develop proof of concept for invoice parsing using a small subset of invoices (3–6 months).
* Phase 2: Evaluate ROI and data quality improvements before scaling to other processes.
* Phase 3: Gradually expand to expense categorization and anomaly detection once invoice automation proved value.
* A decision framework was provided to guide strategic investment choices in AI.

## 2. Medical Equipment Routing AI Diagnostic (2019)

**Business Problem Statement:**

* Conducted for a company specializing in home assistance with medical equipment.
* They dispatch, retrieve, and maintain large numbers of devices (e.g., oxygen concentrators, beds, wheelchairs) to customers at home.
* The challenge was to optimize delivery routes, reduce delays, and improve planning for equipment maintenance and retrieval.

**Key Findings & Recommendations:**

* Implement real-time routing optimization for equipment delivery and pickup, reducing travel time.
* Apply demand forecasting to anticipate peaks (e.g., seasonal illnesses) and optimize stock allocation across warehouses.
* Introduce predictive maintenance scheduling to prevent breakdowns and improve customer satisfaction.
* Risks included the quality of historical logistics data, integration with existing planning software, and adoption by dispatch staff.
* Data is not easy to extract from their ERP.

**Quantifiable Outcomes:**

* Estimated **20–30% reduction in daily travel distance**, saving \~**2–3 hours per driver per day**.
* **10–15% reduction in fuel and logistics costs** across the fleet.
* Improved utilization of equipment stock by **20–25%**, reducing idle equipment.
* Maintenance-related breakdowns projected to drop by **25–30%**, improving service reliability.

**Recommended Next Steps:**

* Phase 1: Pilot routing optimization in one regional hub (3–6 months).
* Phase 2: Roll out demand forecasting models using historical delivery/maintenance records.
* Phase 3: Deploy predictive maintenance system leveraging repair history and IoT sensor data on critical equipment.

## 3. Public Works Tender Analysis AI Diagnostic (2020)

**Business Problem Statement:**

* The client’s mission was to monitor public works tenders of a given city and detect overlaps between projects targeting the same roads.
* The objective was to identify cases where different providers (e.g., telecom and water companies) planned to dig the same road within a short timeframe.
* By alerting providers of these overlaps, they could synchronize their interventions, avoiding repeated digging and refilling of roads, and saving both time and money.
* The diagnostic assessed how AI could support automated analysis of tender documents and geographic areas to highlight opportunities for mutualization.

**Key Findings & Recommendations:**

* Natural language processing (NLP) and information extraction were identified as key to parsing tender descriptions and extracting details such as location, timeframes, and type of work.
* Geospatial AI and mapping techniques could match tenders to road segments and detect overlaps in time and location.
* For example, if a **telecom operator** planned to replace underground cables on a street in June and a **water utility** scheduled pipe maintenance on the same street in July, the system could flag this overlap for mutualization.
* A rule-based alert system was recommended to notify providers of potential collaboration opportunities and help the city coordinate roadworks.
* Risks included variability in tender document formats, incomplete geolocation data, and the need for city-wide data integration.

**Quantifiable Outcomes:**

* Budget estimates for a pilot solution ranged from **€200K–€350K** depending on the level of geospatial integration.
* Expected benefits: **15–25% reduction in redundant works**, **significant cost savings for providers**, and improved citizen satisfaction due to fewer roadworks.
* Time savings estimated at several weeks per overlapping project through coordinated planning.

**Recommended Next Steps:**

* Phase 1: Build a proof of concept to parse tenders and detect overlaps in one city district (6 months).
* Phase 2: Integrate geospatial mapping to refine overlap detection and improve accuracy.
* Phase 3: Scale solution to cover entire city tenders and create an alerting dashboard for providers and city planners.
