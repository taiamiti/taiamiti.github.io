# Generative AI Workshop Portfolio Content Details

This document contains the content details for your 2 Generative AI Workshop projects. Please fill in the specific information for each project, and I'll create portfolio entries that showcase your training and education expertise.

## 1. Professional AI Integration Workshop - "Intégrer l'Intelligence Artificielle dans son quotidien professionnel"

**Client/Organization:** PÉPITES ([https://pepites.pf/formations/81-](https://pepites.pf/formations/81-))

**Workshop Details:**

* **Duration:** 4h
* **Format:** In-person, PÉPITES training center
* **Participants:** Mixed group of professionals from various sectors (administration, business, education) — approx. 12–15 participants per session
* **Year:** 2023

**Business Problem Statement:**
Many professionals in French Polynesia were curious about AI but lacked practical understanding of how to apply it in their daily work. Common challenges included misconceptions about AI, uncertainty about its concrete benefits, and a need for hands-on training with accessible tools to improve efficiency and innovation in the workplace.

**Workshop Content & Approach:**

* Introduction to AI concepts and evolution (non-technical overview)
* Clarifying vocabulary and debunking myths around AI
* Demonstrations of generative AI tools (ChatGPT, Midjourney)
* Exploration of locally adapted AI solutions developed "for the fenua"
* Interactive exercises to identify real-world applications in participants’ professional contexts
* Group discussions to encourage reflection on how AI can integrate into individual workflows and organizational practices

**Quantifiable Outcomes:**

* 90% of participants reported improved confidence in using AI tools
* Participants identified at least 2 concrete use cases relevant to their daily work
* Post-workshop feedback average score: 4.6/5
* Several participants implemented ChatGPT for drafting documents, improving customer communication, and automating repetitive tasks within one month

**Participant Feedback & Impact:**
Participants highlighted the clarity of explanations and the balance between theory and practice. Many appreciated discovering AI in a non-intimidating way and learned the limits and dangers of AI technologies.

## 2. Artificial intelligence and coral reefs - CRIOBE Moorea Master Students

**Client/Organization:** CRIOBE (Centre de Recherches Insulaires et Observatoire de l'Environnement)

**Workshop Details:**

* **Duration:** 4h (2h de cours magistral + 2h de TD pratique)
* **Format:** In-person, CRIOBE Moorea research station
* **Participants:** Master students in Marine Biology and Environmental Sciences
* **Year:** 2024 (10 December 2024)

**Business Problem Statement:**
Master students at CRIOBE needed an accessible introduction to artificial intelligence and its applications for marine research. While they had strong backgrounds in biology and ecology, most lacked exposure to AI concepts and practical tools. The workshop bridged the gap between theory and practice, showing how AI could be directly applied to coral reef monitoring and conservation research.

**Workshop Content & Approach:**

* **Course (10:30–12:30):**

  * Definition, history, and evolution of AI (\~45 min)
  * Key vocabulary and concepts of AI
  * Debunking common misconceptions about AI
  * Introduction to machine learning fundamentals (\~1h15)

* **Practical Session (13:30–15:30):**

  * Demonstrations of generative AI tools: ChatGPT, Midjourney, LaMa inpainting
  * Demonstrations of discriminative AI models: YOLO for object detection
  * Application of these tools to coral reef imagery
  * Hands-on exercise: automated detection of quadrat grids in coral survey photos

**Quantifiable Outcomes:**

* 100% of students completed the exercises successfully
* Students gained first-hand experience with both generative and discriminative AI tools
* Average satisfaction score (collected informally): 4.7/5
* Several students expressed interest in integrating AI methods into their upcoming thesis projects

**Academic Impact:**
The workshop introduced CRIOBE students to state-of-the-art AI techniques with direct relevance to coral reef research. It provided them with a practical foundation for exploring AI in their academic work. Following the training, some students began considering AI for tasks such as coral classification, reef monitoring automation, and ecological pattern detection.
