Here are some observations from your current site along with business‑growth ideas tailored to your AI consulting and teaching practice. Citations come from recent 2025 reports to ensure the advice aligns with current industry trends.

1. Improve the website’s ability to convert visitors into clients

Clear calls‑to‑action (CTAs) – The home page currently has a tagline but no clear next step. Add prominent CTAs such as “Schedule a free consultation,” “Book a workshop,” or “Download our AI readiness checklist.” Include a short form to capture visitors’ email addresses for follow‑up.

Detailed service pages – Your services section lists consulting, prototyping, deployment, skills transfer and teaching, but each is a brief sentence. Expand these sections to explain what deliverables clients receive, typical timelines and industries served. Providing packaged offerings (e.g., “Discovery Workshop,” “AI Prototype Package,” “Model Deployment & Support”) helps prospects understand how you can help them.

Case‑study driven portfolio – The portfolio shows interesting project images but lacks narrative. For each project, describe the business problem, the AI techniques used and the outcomes (e.g., time saved, accuracy improvement). Potential clients want evidence of impact.

Lead‑capture and nurture – Offer a newsletter or downloadable guide in exchange for visitors’ email addresses. Use AI‑driven email marketing tools to send targeted content. Small‑business owners often struggle to pick the right marketing channels and track ROI

; using AI tools for your own marketing will free your time and model best practices.

Accessible blog – Build out your blog with regular posts about AI trends, ethical AI, case studies and tutorials. Use SEO‑optimized keywords and link each post to relevant services. AI marketing tools can help generate copy quickly and organize your editorial calendar

.

Multi‑language support – Your site already toggles between English and French. Maintain this and consider adding Polynesian language snippets to improve local search visibility.

2. Align offerings with growing market demand and specialization

Industry research shows that the rise of generative AI and data‑analytics is increasing demand for consulting, not reducing it

. However, clients now prefer specialized firms rather than generalists

. Your focus on environmental AI and sustainable applications is a differentiator. To leverage this:

Position yourself as a sustainability & AI specialist. The global market for sustainability consulting is projected to grow from $12.26 billion in 2023 to $43.32 billion by 2029 (CAGR 26.38 %)
alpha-sense.com
. Emphasize your experience in coral monitoring, micro‑plastic detection and waste management, and explain how AI reduces environmental impact. Add an “AI for Sustainability” page outlining services such as reef health monitoring, aquaculture optimization and waste‑sorting automation.

Leverage remote delivery. Remote/hybrid work is now the norm; 78 % of consulting clients expect virtual collaboration
alpha-sense.com
. Highlight your ability to work with clients globally via video conferencing and collaborative platforms. Offer remote workshops and use collaborative project‑tracking tools to maintain transparency.

Offer retainer‑based advisory. Provide ongoing AI strategy support and model monitoring through monthly or quarterly retainers. Many companies lack internal AI expertise and need continuous guidance as AI technologies evolve.

3. Develop AI upskilling and teaching products

Upskilling demand is huge: only 13 % of workers have received AI training and just 14 % of frontline employees have been upskilled compared with 44 % of leaders

. Organisations need help closing this gap, and AI training enhances—rather than replaces—human work
paylocity.com
. Practical actions:

Corporate training packages. Create tailored workshops (virtual or in‑person) such as “AI Literacy for Executives,” “Introduction to Machine Learning,” or “Generative AI for Marketing.” Emphasize that AI enables employees to focus on higher‑value tasks
paylocity.com
.

Modular online courses. Develop asynchronous courses (using platforms like Udemy, Teachable or your own LMS) with short videos, exercises and case studies. Offer beginner, intermediate and advanced tracks and provide certificates of completion.

Soft‑skills emphasis. Training should cover not only technical skills but also critical thinking, creativity, adaptability and ethical reasoning
paylocity.com
, helping participants learn when and why to use AI rather than blindly trusting algorithms.

Partnerships with universities and government. Work with the University of French Polynesia or local training providers to deliver accredited AI courses. Public‑sector upskilling can also open doors to funded projects.

4. Use AI‑powered marketing to scale your outreach

Running a small business means juggling marketing, customer service and operations

Personalize content and follow‑ups. Use AI to tailor newsletters, retarget ads and recommend blog articles to specific audiences. AI marketing levels the playing field by giving small firms the efficiency of larger companies

5. Build thought‑leadership and networks

Speak at events and podcasts. Share insights about generative AI trends, sustainable AI, and your unique projects. The rise of autonomous AI agents is pushing businesses to rethink workflows
london.edu
—educational talks on this topic can attract attention.

Publish whitepapers. Summarize best practices, model evaluation guides, or ethical considerations for AI. Offer these as gated content to collect leads.

Engage on LinkedIn. Regularly post project updates, quick AI tips and articles. Comment on posts from key decision‑makers in your target industries.

6. Operational & process recommendations

Implement CRM and project‑tracking tools. This helps you manage contacts, schedule follow‑ups and monitor project status. Tools like HubSpot, Pipedrive or Zoho CRM integrate with marketing automation.

Measure and optimize. Track website traffic, conversion rates and marketing ROI. Use data to refine your offerings and messaging.

By combining clearer website messaging, specialized service offerings, corporate training products and AI‑powered marketing, you can differentiate your consultancy and tap into the growing demand for AI expertise and sustainability. The overarching trend is clear: organizations want partners who can help them navigate generative AI, upskill their teams and meet sustainability goals
