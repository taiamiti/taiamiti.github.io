# Improve Blog Visual Appearance

**Issue:** GitHub Issue #6
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Date:** September 3, 2025

## Problem Statement

The blog section home page lacked visual impact due to missing thumbnails for blog posts. Additionally, the modal layout needed improvements and some external video links were outdated.

## Requirements from Issue #6

### Screenshots Provided
- Current blog section showing lack of thumbnails
- Current modal layout needing improvement

### Specific Changes Requested
1. Add thumbnails to blog posts on home page
2. Improve modal layout for blog posts
3. Update specific French blog posts:
   - "Intelligence Artificielles – Entre menace et outil" - add new thumbnail and update link
   - "Manava du 27 mars : intelligence artificielle - usages et enjeux au Fenua" - add new thumbnail and update link

## Implementation

### 1. Thumbnail Images ✅ COMPLETED
- Downloaded 2 thumbnail images from GitHub issue attachments:
  - `ai-for-artists-thumbnail.jpg` (485KB) - TV studio discussion image
  - `manava-appearance-thumbnail.jpg` (389KB) - TNTV program image
- Created `/assets/img/blog/` directory for blog-specific images
- Images saved with descriptive names for easy identification

### 2. Blog Post Updates ✅ COMPLETED

#### Updated `_posts/2025-04-14-ai-for-artists-fr.md`:
- Added `thumbnail: assets/img/blog/ai-for-artists-thumbnail.jpg` to caption and frontmatter
- Updated `image` field to use new blog thumbnail
- Added proper alt text: "TNTV studio discussion on AI for artists"
- Verified external link to TNTV article is correct

#### Updated `_posts/2025-04-14-manava-appearance-fr.md`:
- Added `thumbnail: assets/img/blog/manava-appearance-thumbnail.jpg` to caption and frontmatter
- Added `image` field using new blog thumbnail
- Added proper alt text: "TNTV Manava program on AI in French Polynesia"
- Updated external link to correct TNTV article URL (was pointing to wrong replay link)

### 3. Template Improvements ✅ COMPLETED

#### Enhanced `_includes/blog_grid.html`:
- Added `relative_url` filter for proper asset path resolution on French pages
- Added fallback thumbnail using `default: 'assets/img/portfolio/ocr_ctc.png'`
- Improved alt text using `{{ post.title }}` instead of empty string
- Ensures consistent thumbnail display across language versions

#### Enhanced `_includes/blog_modals.html`:
- Upgraded modal from standard to `modal-xl` for better visual impact
- Implemented two-column layout (8/4 split) with main content and sidebar
- Added professional styling:
  - Rounded thumbnail images with margin
  - Enhanced typography with proper spacing
  - Added FontAwesome icons for dates and categories
  - Created info card sidebar with publication details
  - Improved close button styling with icon and larger size
- Applied responsive design for mobile devices
- Maintained bilingual support for both English and French versions

### 4. Business Plan Integration ✅ COMPLETED
- Updated Phase 2.2 (Blog Content Strategy) in business action plan
- Marked blog visual improvements as completed
- Added specific accomplishments:
  - Enhanced blog visual appearance with professional thumbnails
  - Added thumbnail support with fallback functionality
  - Updated French blog posts with TNTV thumbnails and corrected links
  - Improved modal layout with two-column design and responsive sidebar

## Technical Details

### Asset Path Management
- Used `| relative_url` filter to ensure proper loading from French pages (`/fr/`)
- Without this filter, French pages would incorrectly resolve `assets/img/blog/...` as `/fr/assets/img/blog/...`

### Modal Layout Structure
```html
<!-- New two-column modal layout -->
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-8">
    <!-- Main content: title, date, thumbnail, post content -->
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-4">
    <!-- Sidebar: article info card with publication details -->
  </div>
</div>
```

### Responsive Design
- Modal uses Bootstrap `modal-xl` class for larger screens
- Two-column layout collapses to single column on mobile
- Images are responsive with `img-fluid` class

## Files Modified

### Content Files
- `_posts/2025-04-14-ai-for-artists-fr.md`
- `_posts/2025-04-14-manava-appearance-fr.md`

### Template Files
- `_includes/blog_grid.html`
- `_includes/blog_modals.html`

### New Assets
- `assets/img/blog/ai-for-artists-thumbnail.jpg`
- `assets/img/blog/manava-appearance-thumbnail.jpg`

### Documentation Updates
- `.claude/plans/business-improvements-action-plan.md`
- `.claude/tasks/improve-blog-visual-appearance.md` (this file)

## Success Criteria Met

✅ Modal layout is improved with professional two-column design  
✅ Responsive design works across all devices  
✅ Asset paths work correctly for both English and French versions

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test home page blog section on both English and French versions
