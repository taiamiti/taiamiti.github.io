Digitizing Single Line Diagrams (SLD) is a long and expensive process due to the large diversity of symbols and the high number of occurences. 
Recent advances in object detection and fine-grained image classification offer good solutions to detect and recognize electrical symbols
from schemas automatically. A proprietary database was constructed to train and evaluate state of the art solutions for spotting and then recognizing each symbol.
