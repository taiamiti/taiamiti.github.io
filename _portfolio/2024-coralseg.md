Our coral monitoring solution leverages photo quadrat imagery collected from designated sites in French Polynesia to provide detailed, 
time-series assessments of coral reef coverage. By employing advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques, 
the system automatically detects and classifies coral species. The implementation involves taking high-resolution underwater pictures at specific coral sites, 
processing the collected images through an AI-powered analysis platform, and then display the results on a centralized dashboard.
