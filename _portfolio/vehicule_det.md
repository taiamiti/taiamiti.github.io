Time-lapses of construction sites provide a great way to monitor and supervise construction activities. Construction vehicule presence
is a good indicator of the building stage and having statistics over time provide valuable insight 
for monitoring. While construction vehicule have only a few classes (dump truck, compactor, excavator, loader, mobile crane), their appearance
changes a lot due to their articulated structure and many disctractors are present on the scene. A performance study as conducted to evaluate state
 of the art object detection solutions on this task.
