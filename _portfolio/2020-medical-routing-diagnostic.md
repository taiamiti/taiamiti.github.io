**Business Problem Statement:**
Conducted for a company specializing in home assistance with medical equipment, this diagnostic addressed the challenge of optimizing delivery routes for large numbers of devices (oxygen concentrators, beds, wheelchairs) dispatched to customers' homes. The client needed to reduce delivery delays, improve planning for equipment maintenance and retrieval, and optimize their fleet operations across multiple service areas.

**Diagnostic Process:**
Our 3-session diagnostic workshop included:
- **Session 1:** Current routing operations assessment and data extraction challenges from existing ERP systems
- **Session 2:** Optimization algorithm evaluation for delivery/pickup routing and demand forecasting capabilities
- **Session 3:** Implementation roadmap for predictive maintenance scheduling and real-time route optimization

**Key Findings & Recommendations:**
- **Real-time routing optimization** for equipment delivery and pickup identified as primary opportunity, reducing travel time significantly
- **Demand forecasting models** recommended to anticipate seasonal peaks (e.g., flu seasons) and optimize stock allocation across warehouses
- **Predictive maintenance scheduling** system proposed to prevent equipment breakdowns and improve customer satisfaction
- **Key challenges identified**: Data quality issues in historical logistics records, integration complexity with existing planning software, and staff adoption concerns
- **ERP integration barrier**: Existing data was not easily extractable from their current enterprise resource planning system

**Quantifiable Outcomes:**
- **Travel efficiency gains**: 20–30% reduction in daily travel distance, saving approximately 2–3 hours per driver per day
- **Cost reduction potential**: 10–15% reduction in fuel and logistics costs across the entire fleet
- **Equipment utilization improvement**: 20–25% better utilization of equipment stock, reducing idle equipment inventory
- **Service reliability**: Maintenance-related breakdowns projected to drop by 25–30%, improving overall service reliability
- **Resource optimization**: Better allocation of drivers and vehicles based on predictive demand patterns

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. **Phase 1**: Pilot routing optimization system in one regional hub to validate improvements (3–6 months)
2. **Phase 2**: Roll out demand forecasting models using historical delivery and maintenance records
3. **Phase 3**: Deploy predictive maintenance system leveraging repair history and IoT sensor data on critical equipment
4. **Integration strategy**: Develop data extraction solutions for existing ERP system to enable AI implementation

This diagnostic provided the client with a comprehensive strategy for leveraging AI to optimize their home medical equipment logistics operations, with clear ROI projections and implementation priorities.
