**Business Problem Statement:**
The client wanted to explore the potential of AI for accounting workflows, driven by the rising interest in deep learning and document understanding technologies. The objective was to assess which accounting processes (invoice processing, reconciliation, reporting) could realistically be automated with AI, while providing concrete budget estimates for building invoice parsing software and other AI-enabled automations. The diagnostic also examined risk factors, feasibility constraints, and business areas with the strongest potential ROI.

**Diagnostic Process:**
Our 3-session diagnostic workshop included:
- **Session 1:** Current accounting workflow mapping and data infrastructure assessment, focusing on invoice processing bottlenecks
- **Session 2:** AI technology evaluation for document processing, OCR capabilities, and NLP-based field extraction
- **Session 3:** Implementation roadmap development with budget scenarios and risk assessment framework

**Key Findings & Recommendations:**
- **Invoice parsing using AI (OCR + NLP)** was identified as the most promising entry point for automation
- **Expense categorization and anomaly detection** in financial reporting were highlighted as viable medium-term opportunities
- **Reconciliation and compliance checking** were identified as longer-term, higher complexity use cases requiring more advanced AI
- **Key risks identified**: data quality issues in existing invoices, change management challenges in finance teams, and uncertainty around vendor tool maturity
- **Data annotation challenge**: While many invoices were available, they were only partially annotated, requiring additional preparation for AI model training

**Quantifiable Outcomes:**
- **Implementation budget scenarios**: €150K–€250K for initial invoice parsing software deployment
- **Expected efficiency gains**: 50–70% reduction in manual data entry time across invoice processing workflows
- **ROI timeline**: Faster invoice turnaround and reduced processing overhead identified as primary value drivers
- **Risk mitigation strategies**: Decision framework provided to guide strategic AI investment choices

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. **Phase 1**: Develop proof of concept for invoice parsing using a small subset of invoices (3–6 months)
2. **Phase 2**: Evaluate ROI and data quality improvements before scaling to other accounting processes
3. **Phase 3**: Gradually expand to expense categorization and anomaly detection once invoice automation proved business value
4. **Decision framework**: Structured approach provided to guide future AI investment priorities

This diagnostic equipped the client with realistic budget expectations, concrete ROI projections, and a phased implementation strategy for integrating AI into their accounting operations.
