Recent advances in deep learning have show great potential for crowd counting from 2D images. While several solutions 
require dedicated cameras (2d or 3d) for high precision counting, recent methods leverage existing surveillance cameras and 
achieving decent performance around 90% accuracy. The severe occlusion in crowded spaces remains challenging but promising performance 
are obtained in somewhat controlled indoor environement. Density-based approaches as well as head detection approches have been 
evaluated on high view point scenes in airports and close view point in buses.
