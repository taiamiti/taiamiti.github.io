**Business Problem Statement:**
Client needed to understand the feasibility and approach for developing an AI system capable of generating accurate 3D models from indoor scans. The challenge involved navigating complex research literature, identifying viable algorithms, and creating a practical roadmap from research to proof of concept.

**Diagnostic Process:**
Our 3-session diagnostic workshop included:
- **Session 1:** Comprehensive state-of-the-art review of 3D reconstruction algorithms and indoor modeling techniques
- **Session 2:** Analysis of available datasets, data requirements, and annotation strategies for training custom models  
- **Session 3:** Technical roadmap development covering data ingestion pipelines, model training workflows, and evaluation metrics

**Key Findings & Recommendations:**
- **Promising Algorithm Identified:** Selected optimal deep learning approach based on performance benchmarks and implementation complexity
- **Dataset Strategy:** Mapped publicly available databases suitable for initial training and validation
- **Technical Pipeline:** Designed complete workflow from data ingestion through model evaluation
- **Implementation Phases:** Structured 6-month roadmap breaking down proof of concept into manageable milestones

**Quantifiable Outcomes:**
- **Research Acceleration:** 6 weeks of literature review condensed into focused recommendations
- **Risk Reduction:** Technical feasibility validated before major development investment  
- **Clear Roadmap:** Actionable 6-month plan with defined milestones and success metrics
- **Resource Planning:** Detailed requirements for data annotation, compute resources, and technical expertise

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. **Phase 1:** Dataset acquisition and preprocessing pipeline development (Weeks 1-4)
2. **Phase 2:** Initial model implementation and training infrastructure setup (Weeks 5-12)  
3. **Phase 3:** Proof of concept development and validation (Weeks 13-20)
4. **Phase 4:** Performance evaluation and optimization (Weeks 21-24)

This diagnostic provided the client with confidence to proceed with development, clear technical direction, and realistic timeline expectations for their 3D indoor modeling AI initiative.
