**Business Problem Statement:**
The client's mission was to monitor public works tenders of a given city and detect overlaps between projects targeting the same roads. The objective was to identify cases where different utility providers (telecom companies, water utilities, etc.) planned to excavate the same road within short timeframes. By alerting providers of these overlaps, they could synchronize their interventions, avoiding repeated digging and refilling of roads, saving both time and money while reducing citizen inconvenience.

**Diagnostic Process:**
Our 3-session diagnostic workshop included:
- **Session 1:** Current tender monitoring processes and document format analysis across different utility providers
- **Session 2:** AI technology evaluation for natural language processing and geospatial analysis of tender documents
- **Session 3:** Implementation strategy for automated overlap detection and provider alert system

**Key Findings & Recommendations:**
- **Natural language processing (NLP) and information extraction** identified as key technologies for parsing tender descriptions and extracting location, timeframes, and work types
- **Geospatial AI and mapping techniques** recommended to match tenders to specific road segments and detect temporal/geographic overlaps
- **Example scenario**: System could flag when a telecom operator plans underground cable replacement on a street in June while a water utility schedules pipe maintenance on the same street in July
- **Rule-based alert system** proposed to notify providers of collaboration opportunities and help city coordinate roadworks
- **Implementation challenges**: Variability in tender document formats, incomplete geolocation data, and need for city-wide data integration

**Quantifiable Outcomes:**
- **Implementation investment**: €200K–€350K budget estimates for pilot solution depending on geospatial integration complexity
- **Efficiency improvements**: 15–25% reduction in redundant roadworks through coordinated planning
- **Cost savings**: Significant cost savings for utility providers through synchronized interventions
- **Time optimization**: Several weeks saved per overlapping project through coordinated planning
- **Citizen impact**: Improved satisfaction due to fewer and shorter roadwork disruptions

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. **Phase 1**: Build proof of concept to parse tenders and detect overlaps in one city district (6 months)
2. **Phase 2**: Integrate geospatial mapping capabilities to refine overlap detection accuracy
3. **Phase 3**: Scale solution to cover entire city tender database and create alerting dashboard for providers and city planners
4. **Stakeholder engagement**: Develop collaboration framework with utility providers for coordinated planning

This diagnostic provided the client with a comprehensive strategy for using AI to optimize city-wide infrastructure coordination, reducing redundant works and improving urban planning efficiency.
