**Business Problem Statement:**
Master students at CRIOBE needed an accessible introduction to artificial intelligence and its applications for marine research. While they possessed strong backgrounds in biology and ecology, most lacked exposure to AI concepts and practical tools. The workshop bridged the gap between marine science theory and AI practice, demonstrating direct applications to coral reef monitoring and conservation research.

**Workshop Format & Approach:**
**Duration**: 4 hours (2h lecture + 2h practical session)  
**Date**: December 10, 2024  
**Format**: In-person at CRIOBE Moorea research station  
**Participants**: Master students in Marine Biology and Environmental Sciences  

**Curriculum Delivered:**

**Theoretical Foundation (10:30–12:30):**
- **AI History & Evolution**: Comprehensive overview of artificial intelligence development (~45 minutes)
- **Key Vocabulary & Concepts**: Essential AI terminology and foundational concepts
- **Myth-Busting**: Addressing common misconceptions about AI capabilities and limitations
- **Machine Learning Fundamentals**: Introduction to core ML principles and applications (~1h15)

**Practical Application Session (13:30–15:30):**
- **Generative AI Tools**: Hands-on demonstrations of ChatGPT, Midjourney, and LaMa inpainting
- **Discriminative AI Models**: Practical experience with YOLO for object detection
- **Marine Research Applications**: Direct application of AI tools to coral reef imagery analysis
- **Hands-on Exercise**: Automated detection of quadrat grids in coral survey photographs

**Quantifiable Outcomes:**
- **Complete Engagement**: 100% of students successfully completed all practical exercises
- **Technical Proficiency**: Students gained first-hand experience with both generative and discriminative AI tools
- **High Satisfaction**: Average satisfaction score of 4.7/5 (collected informally)
- **Academic Integration**: Several students expressed strong interest in integrating AI methods into upcoming thesis projects
- **Practical Skills**: Students demonstrated ability to apply AI tools to real coral reef research scenarios

**Academic Impact & Applications:**
The workshop introduced CRIOBE students to state-of-the-art AI techniques with direct relevance to coral reef research, providing them with a practical foundation for exploring AI in their academic work. Following the training, students began considering AI applications for:

- **Coral Classification**: Automated species identification in reef surveys
- **Reef Monitoring Automation**: Streamlined analysis of underwater photography
- **Ecological Pattern Detection**: AI-powered analysis of environmental data
- **Research Efficiency**: Accelerated data processing and analysis workflows

**Long-term Research Value:**
- **Enhanced Research Capabilities**: Students equipped with cutting-edge AI tools for marine research
- **Academic Innovation**: Integration of AI methods into marine biology thesis projects
- **Research Quality**: Improved accuracy and efficiency in coral reef monitoring and analysis
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Students positioned to advance AI applications in marine conservation

This workshop successfully demonstrated how specialized AI training can enhance academic research capabilities, bridging the gap between advanced technology and marine science applications while maintaining focus on practical implementation and research relevance.
