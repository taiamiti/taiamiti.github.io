In order to design custom eartips, 3d scans of the ear and its canal are required. A solution based on CNNs
has been developped in order to track ear landmarks during smartphone scaning. Inspired by facial landmarks research, a 
deep learning based solution was trained on a proprietary database to detect ear landmarks. The solution achieved high accuracy 
and has been deployed successfully.
