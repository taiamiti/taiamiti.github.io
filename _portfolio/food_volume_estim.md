Food volume estimation is an important challenge with many applications ranging from measuring calories in a diet management program to estimating the cooking time depending on 
the nature and thickness of the ingredients when following a recipe.

A study was conducted to experiment vision-based solutions and a prototype was developped in the form of an android app. From multiple pictures of the ingredients, the app is
able to recover the thickness and surface of each ingredient with good precision.
