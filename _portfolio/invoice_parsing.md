Accounting entry of invoices is a long and tedious task and many solutions exist on the market to help accelerate the process.
Traditional image processing combined with rule-based algorithms suffer from generalising to the large diversity of invoice templates.
Hence, deep learning based solutions with continuous training are now the leading tehnologies as they can adapt to new templates provided that 
enough examplars are seen. In this work, a generic state of the art OCR service has been deployed in conjunction with a custom trained key information retrieval 
neural network model to infer the different accounting fields on the invoice.
